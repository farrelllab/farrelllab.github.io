Cheng-Yi Chen has joined the lab as a new post-doc! He received his PhD from the Stowers Institute, where he worked in the lab of Matt Gibson. He studied the anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> and established that <i>Nematostella</i> primordial germ cells (PGCs) arise at the interface between <i>hedgehog</i> and <i>patched</i> expression domains in the developing mesentery, and that Hedgehog signaling is required for their specification. This supports the idea that the <i>Nematostella</i> PGCs are specified by inductive (zygotic) signals. 

In the lab, he is focused on cells that undergo trans-specification during development and switch from one transcriptional program to another. He will investigate what causes cells to be trans-specified, follow them to determine their final fate and functionality, and investigate the mechanisms that enable this transcriptional transition.

Welcome, Cheng-Yi!
