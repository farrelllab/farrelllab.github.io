Like most research institutions across the world, we have shifted our focus fully to working from home. While it is disappointing to delay our research and the ramp up of the lab, we are happy to do so for the safety of the members of the lab and to protect members of the community. The NIH's response to the pandemic is very inpsiring -- both its decisions to protect its employees as well as the exciting research going on to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic. We are proud to be a part of this institution.
