We've finally opened the doors to the lab in NIH's historic Building 6 complex. The building hosts the largest zebrafish facility in North America, an excellent bioinformatics group, great microscopes, and a host of zebrafish and developmental biology experts across all model organisms. We're excited to be a part of this dynamic research environment. If that sounds appealing, we're actively recruiting post-bacs, graduate students, and post-docs to come work in the lab, so check out our planned [research](../../research) and [apply!](../../apply)
