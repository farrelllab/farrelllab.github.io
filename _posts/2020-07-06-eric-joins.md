Eric Upton has joined the lab as a new post-bac! He graduated from University of Maryland, where he worked on characterizing the kinetics and spectral properties of melanopsin, as well as rod and cone opsins from several animals. In the lab, he's learning to work with scRNAseq data and imaging data as he studies the early embryonic response to DNA damage. 

Welcome, Eric!
