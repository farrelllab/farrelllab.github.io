The [2018 Breakthrough of the Year](https://vis.sciencemag.org/breakthrough2018/) was chosen by *Science* magazine as "Development cell by cell." This collection of 11+ studies focused on emerging approaches to use single-cell genomics to reconstruct developmental trajectories and lineage during the development of several organisms, including zebrafish, frogs, mice, planarians, axolotl, and nematodes. 

Our work using single-cell genomics to profile early development in zebrafish, develop the software URD, and reconstruct the trajectories of early embryogenesis was one of the featured studies. We are very excited that our image was chosen to represent this amazing field on the cover.
