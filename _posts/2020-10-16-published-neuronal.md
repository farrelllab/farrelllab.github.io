"Emergence of neuronal diversity during vertebrate brain development" is finally [out](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2020.09.023)! After some significant changes from the [preprint](../../2019/11/biorxiv-emergence-neuronal.html), our work is published in Neuron. An example of a great, constructive review process. Also, the first paper with Jeff's NIH affiliation!
