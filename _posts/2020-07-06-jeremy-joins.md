Jeremy Popowitz has joined the lab as a new post-bac! He graduated from American University where he researched the effects of hypoglycemia and endocrine disruptors on zebrafish behavioral responses and neural morphology. In the lab, he's learning to work with scRNAseq data and further his imaging skills as he studies the early embryonic response to DNA damage. 

Welcome, Jeremy!
