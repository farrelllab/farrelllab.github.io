*Nature Biotechnology* curated a collection of "25 landmark papers published across [their] history" as part of their [25th Anniversary Collection](https://www.nature.com/collections/gehbfbgdij/). One of Jeff's co-first author papers from his post-doc, "Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data" was selected as one of these papers!

The project was an incredibly fun (and productive) collaboration, and Nature Biotechnology invited Rahul and Jeff to tell the [personal story behind the manuscript](https://bioengineeringcommunity.nature.com/posts/spatial-reconstruction-of-single-cell-gene-expression-data), discussing the experience of working together, melding our fields, and finding our places in the field.

Additionally, you can read the paper here: [Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3192)
