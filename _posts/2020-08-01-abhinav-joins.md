Abhinav Sur has joined the lab as a new post-doc! He received his PhD from Clark University, where he worked in the lab of Neva Meyer. He worked on characterizing neurogenesis and development in the spiralian annelid, Capitella teleta, including its genetic and signaling inputs. In the lab, he is focused on characterizing zebrafish specification and differentiation using single-cell genomics to investigate the modular organization of development.

Welcome, Abhinav!
