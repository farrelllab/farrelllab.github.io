## Lab Picnic
### November 10, 2020

Before the onset of winter, the lab decided to gather for a socially distanced picnic for some much-needed lab bonding. Here's to a much more active lab life once the pandemic is over and it's safer to gather!

## Publication: Emergence of neuronal diversity during vertebrate brain development
### October 16, 2020

"Emergence of neuronal diversity during vertebrate brain development" is finally out! After a great review process that resulted in some significant changes from the preprint, our work is published in <i>Neuron</i>.

Read it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2020.09.023">here!</a>

## Abhinav joins the lab!
### August 1, 2020

Abhinav Sur has joined the lab as a new post-doc! He received his PhD from Clark University, where he worked in the lab of Neva Meyer. He worked on characterizing neurogenesis and development in the spiralian annelid, Capitella teleta, including its genetic and signaling inputs. In the lab, he is focused on characterizing zebrafish specification and differentiation using single-cell genomics to investigate the modular organization of development.

Welcome, Abhinav!

## Lab reopens with (very) limited staffing
### July 20, 2020

Thank goodness, we're back in the lab again. Staffing levels are reduced (and will be likely for the rest of the year), but it sure does feel good to say hello to the fish and to do an experiment.

## Eric and Jeremy join the lab
### July 6, 2020

Two new post-bacs joined the lab today!

Eric Upton has joined the lab as a new post-bac! He graduated from University of Maryland, where he worked on characterizing the kinetics and spectral properties of melanopsin, as well as rod and cone opsins from several animals. In the lab, he's learning to work with scRNAseq data and imaging data as he studies the early embryonic response to DNA damage.

Jeremy Popowitz has also joined the lab as a new post-bac. He graduated from American University where he researched the effects of hypoglycemia and endocrine disruptors on zebrafish behavioral responses and neural morphology. In the lab, he's learning to work with scRNAseq data and further his imaging skills as he studies the early embryonic response to DNA damage. 

Welcome, Eric and Jeremy!

## Lab shifts to Work From Home
### March 23, 2020

Like most research institutions across the world, we have shifted our focus fully to working from home. While it is disappointing to delay our research and the ramp up of the lab, we are happy to do so for the safety of the members of the lab and to protect members of the community. The NIH's response to the pandemic is very inpsiring -- both its decisions to protect its employees as well as the exciting research going on to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic. We are proud to be a part of this institution.

## Paulina joins the lab!
### February 10, 2020

Paulina Capar has joined the lab as our technician to help organize the lab, maintain our fish colony, and support the other research projects in the lab. She has a background in oceanography and environmental geology, and loves to work with zebrafish.

Welcome, Paulina!

## Lab Opens
### January 6, 2020

We've finally opened the doors to the lab in NIH's historic Building 6 complex. The building hosts the largest zebrafish facility in North America, an excellent bioinformatics group, great microscopes, and a host of zebrafish and developmental biology experts across all model organisms. We're excited to be a part of this dynamic research environment. If that sounds appealing, we're actively recruiting post-bacs, graduate students, and post-docs to come work in the lab, so check out our planned [research](../../research) and [apply!](../../apply)
