# URD

URD is an R package for reconstructing transcriptional trajectories underlying specification or differentiation processes in the form of a branching tree, using single cell RNA-sequencing data. URD uses a diffusion map projection of the data and works by simulating biased random walks through that projection. The package is named for the Norse mythological figure who nurtures the world tree and decides all fates.

URD is described and applied to early zebrafish embryogenesis in:
