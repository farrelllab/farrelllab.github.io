[URD](https://github.com/farrellja/URD) is an R package for reconstructing transcriptional trajectories underlying specification or differentiation processes in the form of a branching tree, using single cell RNA-sequencing data. URD uses a diffusion map projection of the data and works by simulating biased random walks through that projection.

Visit URD's [Github repository](https://github.com/farrellja/URD) to get started by [installing it](https://github.com/farrellja/URD/blob/master/INSTALL.md) and trying out the [quick-start tutorial.](https://github.com/farrellja/URD/blob/master/Analyses/QuickStart/URD-QuickStart-AxialMesoderm.md)

URD is described and applied to early zebrafish embryogenesis in:
