## Lab Dinner
### June 30, 2021

Finally the restrictions are beginning to lift, and the lab was able to gather for a real night out. Great company, as always. We are still looking forward to a full opening of the lab so that we can have as much fun during the day as well!

## Jeff's work was featured as one of Nature Biotechnology's 25 landmark papers
### March 10, 2021

*Nature Biotechnology* curated a collection of "25 landmark papers published across [their] history" as part of their [25th Anniversary Collection](https://www.nature.com/collections/gehbfbgdij/). One of Jeff's co-first author papers from his post-doc, "Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data" was selected as one of these papers!

The project was an incredibly fun (and productive) collaboration, and Nature Biotechnology invited Rahul and Jeff to tell the [personal story behind the manuscript](https://bioengineeringcommunity.nature.com/posts/spatial-reconstruction-of-single-cell-gene-expression-data), discussing the experience of working together, melding our fields, and finding our places in the field.

Additionally, you can read the paper here: [Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3192)

## Cheng-Yi Joins the Lab
### February 15, 2021

Cheng-Yi Chen has joined the lab as a new post-doc! He received his PhD from the Stowers Institute, where he worked in the lab of Matt Gibson. He studied the anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> and established that <i>Nematostella</i> primordial germ cells (PGCs) arise at the interface between <i>hedgehog</i> and <i>patched</i> expression domains in the developing mesentery, and that Hedgehog signaling is required for their specification. This supports the idea that the <i>Nematostella</i> PGCs are specified by inductive (zygotic) signals. 

In the lab, he is focused on cells that undergo trans-specification during development and switch from one transcriptional program to another. He will investigate what causes cells to be trans-specified, follow them to determine their final fate and functionality, and investigate the mechanisms that enable this transcriptional transition.

Welcome, Cheng-Yi!
