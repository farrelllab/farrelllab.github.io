We're looking for enthusiastic lab members who want to combine classic embryology and cutting-edge single-cell genomics approaches to find new ways to investigate long-standing, important questions in developmental biology. We have fully-funded positions available at all levels, though we encourage members of the lab to pursue independent fellowships to further their career growth and development.

## Post-doctoral Fellows

Post-docs in the lab can start their own projects or lead on-going projects in the lab. Research experience in one or more of the following areas is a plus: early embryonic or zebrafish development, genetics, imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, or computational biology. To apply, please send a cover letter (2-3 paragraphs describing your desired start date, research experience, and why you would like to join us), a CV with bibliography, and contact information for 3 references to [jfarrell@g.harvard.edu](mailto:jfarrell@g.harvard.edu).

## Graduate Students

While the NIH does not have its own graduate program, there are two ways that PhD candidates can perform their thesis research in our lab:
1. Through established [NIH-institutional partnerships](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/gpp/institutionalpartnerships/longform), such as with Johns Hopkins University, Georgetown University, University of Oxford, and University of Cambridge.
2. [Individual partnerships](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/gpp/IndividualPartnership) with other universities can be established on a case-by-case basis. 

If you are potentially interested in performing your thesis research in our lab, please get in touch: [jfarrell@g.harvard.edu](mailto:jfarrell@g.harvard.edu)

## Post-bac

We are very interested in mentoring students who have been accepted to the [NIH Postbaccalaureate Intramural Training Program](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta) who want to learn about early embryonic development, zebrafish genetics, microscopy, and single-cell RNAseq. This program allows recent college graduates to perform research full-time and is an excellent way to prepare for a future career in research or medicine. 

## Technicians

We are interested in hiring a technician to help manage our fish colony and lab. If you are interested, please write to [jfarrell@g.harvard.edu](mailto:jfarrell@g.harvard.edu) describing why you want to join us, your previous experience, and your goals for this position.
